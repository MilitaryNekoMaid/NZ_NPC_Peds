# Research 🏫

Upon doing some research, I stumbled across an article by [Wiki News](https://en.m.wikinews.org/wiki/Game_modified_to_match_New_Zealand) that discussed *"A New Zealand teenager's conversion of the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) video game is gaining popularity and the New Zealand Police are unhappy at their portrayal."*

I want to express to any law enforcement that I have no control over how people use these retextures in their games/servers and that much like the article says, *"If people want to start getting all legal and stuff, then I will just remove it. I don't want to offend anyone, I don't hate NZ Police"* and this was not created for any ill intent.

# Bugs 🐛

- Firefighter Male and Paramedic Male may spawn with textures all weird if using vMenu. Change Hands / Upper Body and it should fix it.

- Firefighter Male may spawn with stethoscope around neck or incorrect skin tone for hands. I used the paramedic ped, reskinned it and replaced their head textures etc.
